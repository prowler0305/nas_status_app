# Introduction

Welcome to the U.S. Cellular Engineering REST API. The purpose of this API is to provide a simple, easy to use interface to the data sources used at U.S Cellular to retrieve all types of data.

This API uses the concept of Representational State Transfer (REST) in which the services are provide via the explicit use of the standard HTTP method protocals (GET, POST, etc).

The purpose of this documentation is completely internal and for the understanding of the code organization, architecture, and design so that other developers can successfully expand the functionality, maintain, and support this API.

## Additional Documentation
